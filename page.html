        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Statue of Liberty</strong> (Liberty Enlightening the World) is one of the most iconic monuments in the world. Located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, it stands as a symbol of freedom, hope, and democracy. The statue was a gift from the people of France to the United States, commemorating the centennial of American independence.</p>
        <p>The monument depicts a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. She holds a torch above her head in her right hand, and a tablet in her left inscribed with the date of the American Declaration of Independence: July 4, 1776.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The idea of the statue was proposed in 1865 by French political thinker Édouard René de Laboulaye. Sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi designed the statue, and construction began in France in 1875. It was completed in 1884, disassembled, and shipped to New York City in 1885.</p>
        <p>The pedestal was funded largely through donations from the American public. The statue was reassembled on Liberty Island and officially dedicated on <strong>October 28, 1886</strong>, by President Grover Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Over time, the Statue of Liberty has welcomed millions of immigrants arriving in the United States and has become a powerful symbol of American ideals. In 1924, it was declared a National Monument and continues to be maintained by the National Park Service.</p>
